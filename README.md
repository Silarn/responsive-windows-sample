responsive-windows-sample
=========================

A sample Windows 8.1 app using responsive web techniques, to accompany the workshop "Taking the Responsive Web to Windows 8" at SXSW 2014

The talk, and this sample project, will outline how to take advantage of the modern web developer's toolkit and best practices to make native Windows 8.1 apps that work elegantly regardless of device, orientation, snap view, or input method. This includes using media queries, CSS multi column layout, pointer events, and more.

#Purpose

This is not a large scale app.  It is kept simple for demonstration.  Many of the practices used in this app came from more than a year and a half working on a large scale health app for Windows 8.

This is a work in progress, and I am committing as I complete new bullet points in the corresponding talk.
